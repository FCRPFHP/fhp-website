<p></p>The Florida Department of Transportation Motor Carrier Compliance Office was created in 1980 by merging Florida Highway Patrol Weight Troop and Safety Enforcement 
function of the Public Service Commission.
On July 1, 2011, the Office of Motor Carrier Compliance officially transitioned from the Florida Department of Transportation to the Florida Highway Patrol as a result
 of Senate Bill 2160.
Today, the Office of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement resides within the Florida Department of Highway
 Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) Division of Florida Highway Patrol (FHP).<p></p>

<p></p>The goals and objectives of the Office of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement are accomplished through data driven enforcement and education programs. 
 Troopers conduct driver/vehicle safety inspections; post-crash inspections; weight, size and registration enforcement; 
compliance investigations; new entrant safety audits; hazardous materials carrier assessments; traffic enforcement; drug interdiction and public awareness education.<p></p>

<p></p>Our mission is as follows:<p></p>

<p></p>1. Reduce the number and severity of commercial motor vehicle related crashes.<p></p>
<P></P>2. Protect the state’s highway and bridge systems from accelerated damage.<p></p>
<p></p>3. Remove dangerous motor carriers, drivers, and vehicles from our highways.<p></p>
