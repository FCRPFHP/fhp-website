<p></p>The Florida Highway Patrol’s Field Training Operations program is designed to ensure that newly certified Troopers transition smoothly from the academy environment 
to real-world patrol duties. Under the supervision of experienced Field Training Officers, recruits are guided through a structured, multi-phase program that evaluates their 
decision-making, officer safety, communication skills, and knowledge of departmental policies. Each phase increases in responsibility, allowing trainees to demonstrate 
competency before advancing. Field Training Operations ensures every Trooper upholds the high standards of professionalism, integrity, and service expected by the 
Florida Highway Patrol while providing a solid foundation for a successful law enforcement career.<p></p>

<p></p>The program is designed to present the recruit with the necessary instruction and guidance to facilitate the use of the academic training of the academy.
This certification does not apply to the subdivision limit.<p></p>
