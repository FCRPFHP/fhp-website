    <p>
        As a recruit you are an employee of the State of Florida. We provide a
        <strong>salary, benefits, meals and lodging</strong> and a positive training atmosphere.
        Recruits are expected to participate in their training and maintain a professional demeanor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The FHP Training Academy is hosted in our training server, led by the Chief Training Officer and other Academy Instructors. The basic recruit class is approximately
        2-3  hours where recruits are challenged physically, mentally and academically during
        their training to ensure they have what it takes for a career in law enforcement.
        The training is conducted in a paramilitary format with strict attention to detail.
        We emphasize teamwork, ethical decision making and professionalism.
    </p>

    <p>
        Training is conducted in many formats. Classroom lectures teach basic concepts, and practical
        exercises require recruits to demonstrate proficiency in skill areas. Law enforcement scenarios
        require recruits to take action and demonstrate their learned skills. Each recruit must achieve
        an 80% or greater on all written exams.
    </p>

    <p>
        New Troopers must complete three phases of field training, where they demonstrate their knowledge,
        skills, and abilities with certified Field Training Officers.
    </p>
